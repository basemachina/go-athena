# V1.0.0 (2020-12-07)

Initial release of go-athena by speee

This was originally created by [another person](https://github.com/segmentio/go-athena), but it has not been maintained for nearly two years, so we decided to repair it. The following functions have been added, including importing some of the issues that were originally up.

- Add Docker environment
- Add linter by reviewdog
- Remove Result Header when executing DDL
- Use workgroup
- Modify test (make each package up to date)
- Establish Result Mode (query result acquisition mode)
